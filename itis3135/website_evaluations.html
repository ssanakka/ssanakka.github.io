            <h3><a href="https://apple.com" target="_blank">Good Website: Apple.com</a></h3>
            <p>Apple's website exemplifies excellent design principles with clean layouts, intuitive navigation, and premium aesthetics that reflect their brand identity.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Contrast:</strong> Excellent use of contrast with white space against product images, clear typography hierarchy, and strategic color accents that guide the eye.</li>
                <li><strong>Repetition:</strong> Consistent design patterns throughout the site, uniform navigation elements, repeated color schemes, and standardized product presentation layouts.</li>
                <li><strong>Alignment:</strong> Perfect grid-based alignment, symmetrical layouts, clean margins, and precise positioning of all elements creating visual harmony.</li>
                <li><strong>Proximity:</strong> Related elements grouped logically, appropriate spacing between sections, and clear visual relationships between content blocks.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3><a href="https://www.lingscars.com" target="_blank">Bad Website: LingsCars.com</a></h3>
            <p>Lings Cars is notoriously known for its chaotic design that violates virtually every web design principle with overwhelming visual noise and confusing navigation.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Contrast:</strong> Poor contrast with clashing colors, animated backgrounds competing with text, and no clear visual hierarchy making content unreadable.</li>
                <li><strong>Repetition:</strong> Inconsistent styling throughout, random font changes, unpredictable layout patterns, and no cohesive design system.</li>
                <li><strong>Alignment:</strong> Elements scattered randomly across the page, no grid structure, inconsistent margins, and chaotic positioning disrupting visual flow.</li>
                <li><strong>Proximity:</strong> Unrelated elements placed together, inadequate spacing, crowded layouts, and no logical grouping of content.</li>
            </ul>
